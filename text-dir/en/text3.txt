This method combines flow analysis, processor-behavior prediction, and bound
calculation in one integrated phase [Lundqvist 2002]. One problem with this
approach is that analysis time is proportional to the actual execution time of
the task. This can lead to a very long analysis, since simulation is typically
orders of magnitudes slower than native execution.
